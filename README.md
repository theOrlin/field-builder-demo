# Field Builder Demo

This is a solution to the [Quick Base Front End Craft Demo problem](https://github.com/QuickBase/interview-demos/tree/master/ui).

## Available Scripts

The project does not have any necessary libbraries uploaded so in order to run it, you need to run:

### `npm install`

Then, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This starts the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) components.
